    <h3>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I
      joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h3>
    <p>I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard
      some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun!
      I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
      completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.</p>

    <h3>The team was very supportive and kept me motivated</h3>
    <p>"I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer for a big company.
      This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself."</p>

    <h3>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from
      their experiences was easy.</h3>
    <p>The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the
      confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The
      standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and
      amazing people.</p>

    <h3>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h3>
    <p>Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who
      can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only
      say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
      hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It
      took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it
      during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
      developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!</p>
